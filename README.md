-> The below link contains files related to Scania data set.

---> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/APS+Failure+at+Scania+Trucks 

---> Go the above link and click on Downoad : Data folder

---> Now you can see 3 files named aps_description.txt,aps_failure_test_set.csv,aps_failure_training_set.csv.Download these 3  
     files and read aps_description.txt file which contains the information about the datasets.

          
---> The challenge is to find missing values in the given dataset.

---> Before executing the program make sure that you follow below steps.

     --> The files named 'aps_failure_test_set.csv' and 'aps_failure_training_set.csv' and 'sample_3.m' must be in the same directory.
     
     --> And also create two files named 'Training_output.csv' and  'Test_ouput.csv' which should be empty and also should be in same directory. 
     
     --> Now open "MATLAB" and go the respective directory in which you have saved all the above files.
     
     --> Open  'sample_3.m' and click on 'RUN'.Now try to open files named 'Training_output.csv' and  'Test_ouput.csv' in which you 
         can see all the values are filled.
